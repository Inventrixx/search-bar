# Livestories Search Bar

A small vanilla search bar to consume locations and their topics

## Installation and running

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

Open index.html of `./dist` directory generated by the build

## Export code

We have two options:

- Run `npm run build` and use the `./dist/main.bundle.js`.
  You must have a `div` element with an id=`search-bar-ls` where you want to create the search bar 

- We can export directly the files from `src`


## TODO

- Define the `div` id attribute where the bar will be created via ENV variable
